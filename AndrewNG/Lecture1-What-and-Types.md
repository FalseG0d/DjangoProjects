Arthur Samuel-"Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitily programmed."
Arthur Samuel created a checkers program which played the game many times learning how to play even better than the Programmer itself.

Tom Mitchel: A well posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

Machine Learning Algorithm:
1. Supervised Learning
2. Un-supervised Learning

Others: Reinforcement Learning, Recommender Systems

Also: Practical advice for learning algorithms.

## Cocktail Party Algorithm

Humans have the ability to concentrate on a single human voice in a group or on simple lyrics/vocals with music in the backround. This however is not the case with machines. This however can be acheived using Cocktail Party Algorithm.
